# Air Quality Monitoring-Readme File

                 This python script is demonstrate the Process of generating synthetic air quality data and using linear regression for prediction. The script is divided into the following steps:

Step 1: Imports
Import the necessary libraries including numpy for numerical computations and the required modules from the sklearn library for data splitting, linear regression, and performance evaluation.

Step 2: Synthetic Data Generation
Generate synthetic air quality data using numpy’s random number generation capabilities. The data includes features such as temperature, humidity, time of day, and previous air quality metrics.

Step 3: Data Splitting
Split the generated data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library. This step ensures that the model is trained on a subset of the data and tested on another subset.



Step 4: Data Preprocessing .
No explicit data preprocessing step is included in the script. However, in a real-world scenario, it’s crucial to handle missing values, outliers, and scale the data appropriately before model training.

Step 5: Model Selection
Choose the linear regression model for the prediction task. The script uses the LinearRegression class from the sklearn library.

Step 6: Model Training
Train the selected linear regression model on the training data using the fit method from the chosen model.

Step 7: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model’s performance using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared (R²) score. This step helps assess the model’s accuracy and predictive capability.

Step 8: Results
Print the results of the model evaluation including Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared (R²) score.
